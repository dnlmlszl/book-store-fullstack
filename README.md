Hi fellow coders!

This application is a part of the Fullstack Open course of the Helsinki Uni.

The application is created with a React frontend, Express backend, and MongoDB database. I use GraphQL for efficient and flexible data handling and fetching operations. The app features robust authorization, allowing users to see and manage only their own books/authors.
